> "The guys [...] have designed and built a very complex platform which we're extremely proud of.<br/>
> Each problem that was presented was resolved quickly and efficiently."<br/> _Alex Econs, Founder & CEO of Everpress_

The frontend of both e-commerce website and application hasn been built, where sellers can pick their products, upload a design and manage their own campaign page through an editor.
