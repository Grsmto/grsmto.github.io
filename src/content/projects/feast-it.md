Bored of hunting down and comparing individual food trucks online, they pictured a sexy, intuitive e-commerce platform that would connect food truck suppliers directly to clients.

From MVP to extended features and SEO optimisations, I took the technical lead on the frontend and UX of the entire product.

> Adrien is a great person to work with: easy to get on with, reliable, super creative, and hard working. We thought his perspective on UX was brilliant and the actual work he did was always of a super high standard.<br/> _Digby Vollrath: CEO & Co-Founder of Feast It_
